 * Shim style properties to work correctly on Web.

 * Some generic properties used by react-native for styling require additional
 * style fields to be included in order to work on Web. For example, setting the
 * `flex` property to control the flexbox layout also requires setting the
 * `display` property to `flexbox` for the `flex` style to take effect.
 * 
 * Using this shimStyles method allows us to minimize the number of style
 * declarations that need to be set or overridden for specific platforms.
 *
 * @param {Object} styles - A dictionary of named style definitions.
 * @returns {Object}
