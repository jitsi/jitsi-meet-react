# Comments

* Comments documenting the source code are required.

  * Comments from which documentation is automatically generated are **not**
    subject to case-by-case decisions. Such comments are used, for example, on
    types and their members. Examples of tools which automatically generate
    documentation from such comments include JSDoc, Javadoc, Doxygen.

  * Comments which are not automatically processed are strongly encouraged. They
    are subject to case-by-case decisions. Such comments are often observed in
    function bodies.

* Comments should be formatted as proper English sentences. Such formatting pays
  attention to, for example, capitalization and punctuation.

# Duplication

* Don't copy-paste source code. Reuse it.

# Formatting

* Line length is limited to 120 characters.

# Naming

* An abstraction should have one name across multiple projects. For example, the
  instance of lib-jitsi-meet's JitsiConnection type should be named connection
  in jitsi-meet-react.
